  ## Bio
  I'm a Cloud Developer Advocate for Microsoft focused on Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Graph and a contributing member of the [Microsoft 365 Patterns and Practices team](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blogs/new-microsoft-365-patterns-and-practices-pnp-team-model-with-new-community-leads/).

  I started developing collaborative applications on SharePoint, and now have expanded this to include the whole Microsoft 365 cloud and parts of Azure. Before joining the Cloud Advocacy team I worked in the One Commercial Partner team, where I helped partners build applications on Microsoft 365. 
  
  Prior to that I was an  Office development MVP and worked for BlueMetal Architects, where I led their SharePoint practice. I also worked at the very first Microsoft Technology Center near Boston, where I led Architecture Design Sessions and did Proof of Concepts for customers building collaborative applications.
