      "Biography": "I've been at Microsoft for 5.5 years, and a contractor for another 6 years prior. In my last role, I worked on docs.microsoft.com, writing C++ and gamedev docs. Before that, I worked on the TED team in DX, helping game developer partners port their titles to Windows and Windows Phone. Our team shipped titles like Candy Crush, as well as popular indie games like Prune and Monument Valley. Prior to that, I started at Microsoft working on [Coding4Fun](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/) under Channel 9. From that role, I'm probably most known for my [.NET Wiimote library](http://github.com/BrianPeek/WiimoteLib), but I have also written a [pile of articles and projects](https://brianpeek.com/projects/), worked a bit on the Kinect for Windows SDK, the Microsoft Mustang ([Project Detroit](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/articles/Project-Detroit-An-Overview)), [BoxingBots](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/projects/BoxingBots), and the [LEGO EV3 Sentry Bot](http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/BUILD-Conference-Highlights/Lego). I have also co-authored two now-outdated books: \"[Coding4Fun: 10 .NET Programming Projects for Wiimote, YouTube, World of Warcraft, and More](http://www.amazon.com/Coding4fun-Programming-Projects-Wiimote-Warcraft/dp/B005SN8BCS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326495821&sr=8-1)\" and \"[Debugging ASP.NET](http://www.amazon.com/Debugging-ASP-NET-Jonathan-Goodyear/dp/0735711410/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326495859&sr=8-1)\". Prior to all that, I worked in several small (and one large) consulting companies you’ve never heard of.  \n\nWhen I'm not working, I'm probably restoring the pinballs in my garage, playing a game, or working on yet another gamedev or emulation project I'll probably never finish (an Atari Lynx game presently). I have several closets filled with gaming memorabilia, original console dev kits, and a variety of other rare and unique gaming items. \n\nFind me at [https://twitter.com/BrianPeek](https://twitter.com/BrianPeek) and [https://brianpeek.com/](https://brianpeek.com/)\n",

      "Biography": "I've been in the tech industry for almost 20 years, though not always in the most traditional ways. \nAt 13 I built my own using spare parts my dad had laying around and I've been a hardware nerd ever since. I have spent my time teaching photoshop workshops, doing business mentoring, building websites, and auditing social media and SEO. I did that for about 10 years, but in 2011, I decided to take this front-end dev thing full time. I took up consulting and got to work with some really cool start-ups and some not so cool enterprises, but in doing so I found myself working with OpenStack. The OpenStack community was rad, and I wanted to contribute so I started with DOCS and after doing that for a while I decided I wanted to do more, so I joined Hackbright as an Engineering Fellow and learned Python. I graduated and was immediately hired by Rackspace. Since then, I've become a huge contributor in the Linux and Go communities and have finally found my happy place as a developer advocate. \nIn my spare time, I'm a mentor at WeWork, General Assembly, AngelHack, and CapitalFactory and I�m on the board of multiple engineering groups including Redis Austin, Big Data Analytics Club, and Austin All Girl Hack Night. My passion is helping more underrepresented individuals join and feel comfortable in tech and I'm often a resource for new developers trying to find their way.\nhttps://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara",

      "Biography": "My career began in 1997 with stints at several internships and startups. My first languages were JavaScript (who would've thought it'd still be a thing today?) and Perl (regex FTW!). In 2002, the dot-com bubble burst and I ended up as a .NET dev at a large enterprise. I was there for over 10 years until I finally got tired of being a real-life Dilbert and started to follow my passions again. Most recently, I was a software architect at an e-commerce startup in Vancouver, BC. In addition to our technical accomplishments, I am proud of the teams we built and the collaborative and DevOps culture that we created.\n\nA few years ago, I discovered and fell in love with Azure. I started blogging, presenting and hosting meetups and events about the platform. I also enjoy interacting with the product teams to make Azure better. I eventually became an Azure MVP, and now has led me to join APEX as a Cloud Developer Advocate. I feel extremely fortunate to be able to do what I love as my full-time 'job' and to have an opportunity to make Azure awesome while working alongside an amazing group of people.\n\nThese days, I split my time building applications in .NET and Node. The Azure technologies that I'm super excited about include: Azure Functions, ACS/Kubernetes, and VSTS.\n\nWhen I'm not in front of a keyboard, I enjoy living in Vancouver and hanging out with my wife and 2 children. I also play hockey, but I am really bad at it; I'm surprised they haven't kicked me out of Canada for that.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/nthonyChu",

      "Biography": "I was most recently the Director of Developer Relations for Telerik which was acquired by Progress Software. Prior to that I held various software engineering roles in retail, healthcare and a really hard year at a startup in the music industry. I started my career as an ASP.NET WebForms developer, but quickly moved to Flex and then eventually JavaScript after Apple killed Flash (Thanks Apple!). \n\n I went to the University of Tennessee at Martin (go Skyhawks?) where I studied Information Systems. Prior to that I served in the US Coast Guard where I painted and cleaned things on the Mississippi River.\n\n I live in Franklin, TN which is a small town outside of Nashville, the greatest city in the world. I play the bass guitar and try to rekindle my dreams of rock stardom. I like to run every day and I'm also a huge fan of napping. I have three boys (all in middle school) so I spend the majority of my time being a dad and working with my kids on their hobbies. I'm also big into home improvement so I spend entirely too much time and money at Lowes. [https://twitter.com/burkeholland](https://twitter.com/burkeholland)",
