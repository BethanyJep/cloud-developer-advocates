## Bio

Hi, I am Kris Nova. I am a back-end infrastructure engineer, with a focus in distributed container orchestration. I love the back-end side of the stack, and have an expertise in computing infrastructure. I contribute to Kubernetes, Go, and many open source projects. I run Archlinux on my surface book, if you want to know more ask me! I enjoy mountain climbing and randomly go on ridiculous adventures. I have a border collie named Charlie, and likes to take naps on top of me while I code. Ask me about Linux and Go!
