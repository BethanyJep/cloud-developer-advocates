  ## Bio

  My years of software development experience has brought me to different development environments and industries such as retail, gaming, and developer tooling and I enjoy sharing what I've learned along the way. What I enjoy most about being a cloud advocate is that I'm always learning new things, it keeps my work exciting! Outside of work I enjoy gaming, gardening, and rollerskating.
