  ## Bio

  Christopher is a long-time web developer and all around geek. He enjoys working with various frameworks and languages, including Python, TypeScript, Svelte, and Django. He's worked on numerous chat bot projects and other AI implementations. He's spent the bulk of his career in the education space in one shape or form. He loves seeing people have those "a-ha" moments.

  When not writing code or delivering a presentation, Christopher can be found running many miles with friends, playing Civilization, Cities: Skylines or Microsoft Flight Simulator, or spending time with his wife and their four-legged child (a rescue dog named Sammy).
