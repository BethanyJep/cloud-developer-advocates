  ## Bio
  I'm a Cloud Developer Advocate for Microsoft focused on Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Graph.
  A contributing member of the [Microsoft 365 Patterns and Practices team](https://pnp.github.io/#team), and maintainer of [CLI for Microsoft365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/).

  I started off as a .Net developer and moved to developing custom applications on SharePoint. Lately developing modern SharePoint/Teams solutions using SPFx and React with a pinch of Azure to it.
  Before joining the Cloud Advocacy team I worked as a developer/consultant, and was also a Microsoft MVP for office development.
  I co-host an M365 podcast called [365 days of cloud](https://365daysofcloud.com/) to discuss a technical topic in each episode and what really works and does not work for developers in the M365 world.
