  ## Bio
  Originally from Caracas, Venezuela. I am passionate about technology for social good, and aim to give my projects some of that outlook. I currently work as part of the Spatial/Mixed Reality team.
  Outside of tech, my hobby is cooking! I love experimenting with new ingredients and trying new cuisines.
  I am also a big futbol (soccer) and hockey fan. Excited to see the Seattle Kraken in the upcoming years, and one day see Venezuela classify to a World Cup.
