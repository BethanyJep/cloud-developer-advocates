## Bio

My current focus is High Scale, Big Data and Distributed Systems.

Having worked in roles from a Software Engineer to Solutions Architect, I have more than 10 years of professional experience and have done engineering within numerous technological streams, consisting of Big Data, Distributed Systems, Deployment and Machine Learning. Programming in .NET C#/F#, Java/Scala, Python, Bash + lots of frameworks for each stack. Designed and implemented large-scale, performant, distributed cloud-native architecture (e.g. with Hadoop, Kubernetes, MBrace, etc.), big data, deployments (containers, Terraform, Packer, etc.), functional programming and machine learning, delivering low latencies, high throughput and efficient data processing

I love interesting conferences and exchange of experience related to distributed systems, big data, cloud, functional programming, machine learning and similar topics!
