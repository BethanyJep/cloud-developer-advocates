  ## Bio
  I do things with IoT and Azure in the Developer Relations team at Microsoft, mainly creating content for students and faculty to help them be successful with Microsoft technologies.
  
  I'm British, so sound way smarter than I actually am, and I'm happy I moved to Redmond in time to be locked down at home and not see the office I came to work in, or the places I wanted to visit.
  
  In the past I've lived in 4 continents working as a developer in the mobile, desktop, and scientific space. I also hate cats, but have a 7 year old daughter who loves cats, so I have 2 cats.
