## Bio

I was most recently the Director of Developer Relations for Telerik which was acquired by Progress Software. Prior to that I held various software engineering roles in retail, healthcare and a really hard year at a startup in the music industry. I started my career as an ASP.NET WebForms developer, but quickly moved to Flex and then eventually JavaScript after Apple killed Flash (Thanks Apple!). 

 I went to the University of Tennessee at Martin (go Skyhawks?) where I studied Information Systems. Prior to that I served in the US Coast Guard where I painted and cleaned things on the Mississippi River.

 I live in Franklin, TN which is a small town outside of Nashville, the greatest city in the world. I play the bass guitar and try to rekindle my dreams of rock stardom. I like to run every day and I'm also a huge fan of napping. I have three boys (all in middle school) so I spend the majority of my time being a dad and working with my kids on their hobbies. I'm also big into home improvement so I spend entirely too much time and money at Lowes. [https://twitter.com/burkeholland](https://twitter.com/burkeholland)
