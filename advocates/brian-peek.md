## Bio

My focus area is game development and emerging technologies.  I have been at Microsoft full-time since 2012 working on a variety of things in these areas, such as helping game developer partners port their titles to Windows and Windows Phone, publishing titles like Candy Crush, as well as popular indie games like Prune and Monument Valley, working on [Coding4Fun](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/) and [Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/), and writing C++ and gamedev docs for [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/).  I'm probably most known for my [.NET Wiimote library](http://github.com/BrianPeek/WiimoteLib), but I have also created a [pile of other articles and projects](https://brianpeek.com/projects/), worked a bit on the Kinect for Windows SDK, the Microsoft Mustang ([Project Detroit](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/articles/Project-Detroit-An-Overview)), [BoxingBots](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/projects/BoxingBots), and the [LEGO EV3 Sentry Bot](http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/BUILD-Conference-Highlights/Lego). I have also co-authored two books: "[Coding4Fun: 10 .NET Programming Projects for Wiimote, YouTube, World of Warcraft, and More](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005SN8BCS/)" and "[Debugging ASP.NET](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735711410/)".

When I'm not working, you'll find me restoring the pinballs in my garage, playing a game, or working on yet another gamedev or emulation project I'll probably never finish. I have several closets filled with gaming memorabilia, original console dev kits, and a variety of other rare and unique gaming items.
