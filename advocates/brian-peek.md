## Bio

I've been at Microsoft for 5.5 years, and a contractor for another 6 years prior. In my last role, I worked on docs.microsoft.com, writing C++ and gamedev docs. Before that, I worked on the TED team in DX, helping game developer partners port their titles to Windows and Windows Phone. Our team shipped titles like Candy Crush, as well as popular indie games like Prune and Monument Valley. Prior to that, I started at Microsoft working on Coding4Fun under Channel 9. From that role, I'm probably most known for my .NET Wiimote library, but I have also written a pile of articles and projects, worked a bit on the Kinect for Windows SDK, the Microsoft Mustang (Project Detroit), BoxingBots, and the LEGO EV3 Sentry Bot. I have also co-authored two now-outdated books: "Coding4Fun: 10 .NET Programming Projects for Wiimote, YouTube, World of Warcraft, and More" and "Debugging ASP.NET". Prior to all that, I worked in several small (and one large) consulting companies youâ€™ve never heard of.  
When I'm not working, I'm probably restoring the pinballs in my garage, playing a game, or working on yet another gamedev or emulation project I'll probably never finish (an Atari Lynx game presently). I have several closets filled with gaming memorabilia, original console dev kits, and a variety of other rare and unique gaming items.
