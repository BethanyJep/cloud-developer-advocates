  ## Bio
  From government cloud architecture to machine learning startups and social media companies my background spans a variety of industries and techologies. I have always had one foot deep into the technology and one foot into all ancillary non-technical discplines. I enjoy creating great developer experiences for new engineers and students. On the Academic Advocacy subteam I focus on Microsoft's Hackathon strategy and co-lead the Healthcare Social Impact League of the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador program.

  Outside of work I enjoy running (half marathons and training for a Boston marathon qualification), playing jazz piano, learning guitar, studying Chinese Mandarin, and engaging in a variety of outdoor activities. I'm passionate about mentoring students and those early in their careers to help them land their feet in the tech industry.
