## Bio

My career began in 1997 with stints at several internships and startups. My first languages were JavaScript (who would've thought it'd still be a thing today?) and Perl (regex FTW!). In 2002, the dot-com bubble burst and I ended up as a .NET dev at a large enterprise. I was there for over 10 years until I finally got tired of being a real-life Dilbert and started to follow my passions again. Most recently, I was a software architect at an e-commerce startup in Vancouver, BC. In addition to our technical accomplishments, I am proud of the teams we built and the collaborative and DevOps culture that we created.

A few years ago, I discovered and fell in love with Azure. I started blogging, presenting and hosting meetups and events about the platform. I also enjoy interacting with the product teams to make Azure better. I eventually became an Azure MVP, and now has led me to join APEX as a Cloud Developer Advocate. I feel extremely fortunate to be able to do what I love as my full-time 'job' and to have an opportunity to make Azure awesome while working alongside an amazing group of people.

These days, I split my time building applications in .NET and Node. The Azure technologies that I'm super excited about include: Azure Functions, ACS/Kubernetes, and VSTS.

When I'm not in front of a keyboard, I enjoy living in Vancouver and hanging out with my wife and 2 children. I also play hockey, but I am really bad at it; I'm surprised they haven't kicked me out of Canada for that.
