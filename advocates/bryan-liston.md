## Bio

Previously I worked at Amazon on AWS, most recently I was a Developer Advocate for AWS Lambda, but I was also involved with DynamoDB and RDS Operations, as well as a stint in the Solution Architecture organization where I helped build out the AWS DevOps professional certification. I've been doing Linux/DevOps related work for the past 15 years in some form or another, developing software and architecting systems/infrastructure.
